      Education and Outreach
    </h4>
    <p>
      MEM&middot;C's innovative education and outreach activities aim to
      inspire broader interest in science and engineering within our
      community and to engage a diverse and talented participant pool in
      our research activities. Signature MEM&middot;C programs seek to
      facilitate STEM career opportunities for veterans, women, and
      underrepresented minorities. Activities also include REU and RET
      programs, K-20 outreach, and partnership with regional community
      colleges.

    <h4>
      Research and Training Partnerships
    </h4>
    <p>
      MEM&middot;C offers a framework for initiatiing and advancing
      collaborative materials research and development with industrial
      partners, and for translating the center's research innovations into
      commercial opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
      MEM&middot;C promotes research collaborations and trainee exchange
      with partner laboratories abroad and at U.S. National Laboratories
      to advance the center's research goals and broaden the scientific
      and cultural experience base of its participants.
