      The University of Washington's Molecular Engineering Materials Center
      (UW MEM&middot;C) coordinates research efforts among two colleges and
      five departments across UW's campus and Pacific Northwest National
      Laboratory (PNNL) to address major trans-disciplinary challenges in
      materials research.

    <h5>IRG&middot;1: Defects in Nanostructures</h5>
    <p>
      is engineering unprecedented physical properties into inorganic
      nanostructures by controlling defect formation and doping, and will
      exploit emergent properties to forge new technological frontiers
      ranging from laser cooling to solar concentration.

      is creating and studying new forms of quantum matter in atomically
      layered materials and controlling novel topological and excitonic
      phase transitions within these materials, with potentially disruptive
      impact on energy and information technologies.
